#Front-end
React + TypeScript + Vite + Lazy loading of images

Yarn? Yep. It's faster than NPM.
React? Yep.
TypeScript? Type safe, scalable, faster to code, IMHO.
Vite? It's faster, way faster and uncomplicated.
Lazy? It's faster to load the site, unblocking components from rendering, while the image comes into the picture. (No pun intended)

Must have NodeLTS, NPM or Yarn. I built it with Yarn.
Donwload the repo @ Github.
Go to the root of the project, via terminal, and write "yarn" or "npm i" without the quotes.

With the back-end running, on the terminal write "yarn dev".

Whatch the sky. Search for asteroids. Pretty cool, huh?
